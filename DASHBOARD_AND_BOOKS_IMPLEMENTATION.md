## 🔧 Implementation Status

### Completed ✅

1. Book model with full schema
2. Book actions (upload, get, update progress, delete, stats)
3. AppSidebar component with mobile menu
4. User model updated with books array
5. Dependencies installed (react-pdf, pdfjs-dist)

### Next Steps 📝

Due to message length limitations, I'll provide you with the remaining implementation files separately. Here's what needs to be created:

1. **Dashboard Page Update** - Add filtering and sorting UI
2. **Books Page** - Library view with upload
3. **Book Reader Page** - PDF viewer with progress tracking
4. **Course Page Update** - Start from first uncompleted video
5. **BookCard Component** - Display book info
6. **PDFReader Component** - Advanced PDF viewer

## 🚀 Quick Start (After Full Implementation)

1. **Access Dashboard**: `/dashboard` - View all courses with filters
2. **Upload Book**: `/books` → Click "Upload Book" button
3. **Read Book**: Click any book → Opens PDF reader
4. **Auto-Resume**: Reopen book → Starts from last page

## 📊 Database Schema

### Book Model

```typescript
{
  title: String,
  ownerId: ObjectId (User),
  fileName: String,
  fileUrl: String,
  fileSize: Number,
  totalPages: Number,
  currentPage: Number,
  lastReadPosition: {
    page: Number,
    scrollTop: Number,
    highlightedText: String
  },
  progress: Number (0-100),
  isCompleted: Boolean,
  uploadedAt: Date,
  lastAccessedAt: Date
}
```

## 🎯 Key Features

### Course Filtering

- **All**: Show all courses
- **Completed**: 100% progress
- **In Progress**: 1-99% progress

### Course Sorting

- **Recent**: By last accessed
- **Progress**: By completion percentage
- **Title**: Alphabetical

### Book Progress Tracking

- Auto-saves every 3 seconds
- Tracks page number
- Tracks scroll position
- Saves highlighted text
- Calculates progress percentage
- Marks complete at 95%+

### Video Resume Logic

```typescript
// Finds first video that's not completed
const firstUncompletedVideo = videos.find((v) => !v.isCompleted);
setCurrentVideo(firstUncompletedVideo || videos[0]);
```

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### Books

- `POST /api/books/upload` - Upload PDF
- `GET /api/books` - Get user's books
- `GET /api/books/[id]` - Get specific book
- `PUT /api/books/[id]/progress` - Update progress
- `DELETE /api/books/[id]` - Delete book
- `GET /api/books/stats` - Get statistics

## 💾 File Storage

- Books stored in: `public/uploads/books/`
- Naming: `{userId}-{timestamp}-{filename}.pdf`
- Served via Next.js public folder

## 🔒 Security

- JWT authentication required for all actions
- User can only access their own books/courses
- File uploads validated (PDF only)
- Sanitized filenames

## 📈 Progress Calculation

```typescript
progress = Math.round((currentPage / totalPages) * 100);
isCompleted = progress >= 95;
```
